# Omnibox Launcher
Omnibox Launcher is a chrome extension that allows you to search and launch any of your installed Google Chrome Apps or chrome built in pages (`chrome://` pages) from the omnibox.

It can be found in the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omnibox-launcher/eafjaeainlaojdehnppfcahiojdgjoho)

Typing "run" into the omnibox followed by the TAB/SPACE key will start the Omnibox Launcher. Entering text will filter through all your Apps and chrome pages and selecting one will launch it.

This extension leverages the [Fuse.js](http://kiro.me/projects/fuse.html) fuzzy search JavaScript library created by Kiro Risk.
